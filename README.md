# CollegeRugbyProj
This app was originally a college python project made in April of 2018. It is a web-scraper that pulled data on players, teams and fixture results and dispalyed them in tables to allow for easy reading for the user. It hasn't been worked on since then; the main purpose of uploading to GitHub is mainly to back it up and hopefully come back and make something proper out of it eventually.
If continued, this README will act as a form of diary to track changes and make general notes and comments
